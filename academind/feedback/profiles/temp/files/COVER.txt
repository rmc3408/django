Hello XXXXX Team,

I would like to apply for the Software Engineer position because I have 3 years of full-time work experience as Full Stack Developer in ALL technologies required in the job posting including XXXXX, and XXXX. 

As proof of my professional skills, I have a collaborative project where I am a team leader of 6 developers where we share the same mindset in well-tested, scalable, and well-organized code. Indeed, my previous experience in startups or large-scale companies such as REDSpace/WarnerMedia, my three recommendation letters and several years (10+) of experience in the academic field made me develop highly competent skills in continuous fast learning, a positive and proactive attitude, passion for mentoring and take ownership to delivery any project.

Certainly, I can provide you with reference letters from my Tech Team Leader, manager and senior co-worker. Even though I do not have exactly XXXX years of experience. Finally, I do not require sponsorship in the future since I am a Canadian Citizen who resides in Toronto.

I am very interested in participating in your company and it is also a perfect scenario for my professional growth. Please, don't hesitate to contact me.


Best regards,
Raphael Molinaro
